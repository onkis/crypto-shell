# Welcome to Cypto Shell. A holding place for initial crypto ideas

The crypto ecosystem moves very quickly. Being able to adapt rapidly is important

This branch is all about building a "traditional" node/express/knex app shell

1. express shell
2. Simple "pug" views
3. Model Layer (knex)
4. build for deployment with esbuild? (single files?)
